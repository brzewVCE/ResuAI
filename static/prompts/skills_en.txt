Based on the user's skill description and job context, generate organized skill categories.

User skill description: {user_description}
Job context: {job_context}

Rules:
- Divide skills into 2-4 logical categories
- Each category should have a name and list of skills
- Tailor to job context - if the job requires specific technologies/skills, include them
- Use English language
- Sort from most important to least important (relative to the job offer)

Return in JSON format:
{{
  "skill_categories": [
    {{"categoryName": "Category name", "entries": "skill1, skill2, skill3"}},
    {{"categoryName": "Category name 2", "entries": "skill4, skill5"}}
  ]
}}

DO NOT add things that are in the {job_context}, such as certificates  i dont have and phrases such as "its nice to have x,y,z"
